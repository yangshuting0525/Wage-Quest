# ✨ Wage Quest ✨

> **Workplace emotional regulator — visualizing dull labor time as a flowing stream of financial gain.**

## Overview
### 🧠 What Wage Quest does

Wage Quest helps workplace users who feel their time is being "wasted" during boring meetings, repetitive tasks, or low-mood periods. By converting abstract time into real-time jumping "income increments," it provides immediate psychological comfort and a sense of value perception.

### ⭐ Core features

- 💹 **Real-time income visualization**: A core counter that displays the total amount earned since the timer started, using smooth "scrolling digit" animations.
- 🎁 **Wishlist integration**: Link labor to consumption desires (e.g., AirPods, consoles). The system calculates "how much longer to work to afford them" and triggers a "PAID" stamp animation upon completion.
- 👔 **Meeting Survival Mode**: Input expected meeting duration to see a countdown progress bar alongside the "heart-warming money" earned during the session.
- 🍔 **Relative Value conversion**: Introduces "workplace hard currency" anchors (e.g., KFC meals, skincare products) to concretize income perception.
- 🎖️ **Slacking Achievement System**: A gamified badge system (e.g., "Meeting Terminator," "Paid Suffering") to increase long-term user stickiness.
- 👻 **Stealth Mode**: A one-key camouflage feature (hotkeys or floating ball) that instantly switches the page to a fake Excel sheet or code editor for security.
- 🧾 **Daily Receipt export**: Generates a retro thermal-style long receipt at the end of the day, summarizing total duration, earnings, and goals achieved.
